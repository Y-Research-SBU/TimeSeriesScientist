The primary goal was to evaluate model performance and identify the best approach for forecasting future values. The experiment utilized various models, with Exponential Smoothing emerging as the preferred choice due to its ability to handle trends and seasonality effectively.\n\n## Key Findings and Model Performance\n\n- **Data Characteristics**: The dataset exhibited a strong upward trend and cyclical patterns, with a normal distribution slightly skewed. Seasonality was present, but the series was non-stationary.\n- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning was effective, achieving a high data quality score of 0.95. Missing values and outliers were adequately handled.\n- **Model Selection**: ARIMA, SVR, and Exponential Smoothing were shortlisted, with Exponential Smoothing selected as the best model due to its robustness in handling trends and seasonality.\n- **Model Performance**: The Exponential Smoothing model was chosen based on moderate confidence, primarily due to its suitability for the data's characteristics.\n\n## Issues and Limitations\n\n- **Short Dataset Duration**: The limited 5-day span restricts the ability to detect long-term trends and seasonality, posing challenges for accurate forecasting.\n- **Non-Stationarity**: The presence of non-stationarity requires careful handling, potentially impacting model performance.\n- **Model Confidence**: The reliance on a single model without extensive comparison data limits confidence in the forecast results.\n\n## Recommendations for Future Work\n\n1. **Data Extension**: Collect a longer dataset to better capture long-term trends and seasonal patterns, enhancing model accuracy.\n2. **Stationarity Handling**: Implement techniques such as differencing and seasonal decomposition to address non-stationarity.\n3. **Model Exploration**: Explore additional models like LSTM or Prophet that may better capture complex patterns in the data.\n4. **Ensemble Methods**: Consider ensemble approaches to combine strengths of multiple models, potentially improving forecast reliability.\n5. **Validation Enhancement**: Increase cross-validation folds and explore more hyperparameter configurations to optimize model performance.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future forecasting efforts can achieve greater accuracy and reliability, supporting more informed decision-making.\n```"

The primary goal was to evaluate model performance and identify the best approach for forecasting future values. The experiment utilized various models, with Exponential Smoothing emerging as the preferred choice due to its ability to handle trends and seasonality effectively.\n\n## Key Findings and Model Performance\n\n- **Data Characteristics**: The dataset exhibited a strong upward trend and cyclical patterns, with a normal distribution slightly skewed. Seasonality was present, but the series was non-stationary.\n- **Preprocessing**: Data cleaning was effective, achieving a high data quality score of 0.95. Missing values and outliers were adequately handled.\n- **Model Selection**: ARIMA, SVR, and Exponential Smoothing were shortlisted, with Exponential Smoothing selected as the best model due to its robustness in handling trends and seasonality.\n- **Model Performance**: The Exponential Smoothing model was chosen based on moderate confidence, primarily due to its suitability for the data's characteristics.\n\n## Issues and Limitations\n\n- **Short Dataset Duration**: The limited 5-day span restricts the ability to detect long-term trends and seasonality, posing challenges for accurate forecasting.\n- **Non-Stationarity**: The presence of non-stationarity requires careful handling, potentially impacting model performance.\n- **Model Confidence**: The reliance on a single model without extensive comparison data limits confidence in the forecast results.\n\n## Recommendations for Future Work\n\n1. **Data Extension**: Collect a longer dataset to better capture long-term trends and seasonal patterns, enhancing model accuracy.\n2. **Stationarity Handling**: Implement techniques such as differencing and seasonal decomposition to address non-stationarity.\n3. **Model Exploration**: Explore additional models like LSTM or Prophet that may better capture complex patterns in the data.\n4. **Ensemble Methods**: Consider ensemble approaches to combine strengths of multiple models, potentially improving forecast reliability.\n5. **Validation Enhancement**: Increase cross-validation folds and explore more hyperparameter configurations to optimize model performance.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future forecasting efforts can achieve greater accuracy and reliability, supporting more informed decision-making.\n```"
